# Setting up a new computer

My personal installation script for a new computer.

Note, this sets up an extremely opinionated and highly personalized installation, with my preferences and dotfiles. Please adjust as needed!

Some resources borrowed from:

- https://gist.github.com/millermedeiros/6615994

## Install from script:

Open the terminal, then:

```sh
bash -c "`curl -L https://git.io/setup-new-mac`"
```
